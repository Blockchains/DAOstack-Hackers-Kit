The goal of DAOstack is to make it as easy as possible to create and manage DAOs, and to use them to drive a new decentralized global economy (specifically, an economy that uses GEN, our collective attention token ). DAOstack Technologies has created an initial DAO called \"Genesis\" with the purpose of promoting the GEN/DAO ecosystem. Genesis is currently live on the Ethereum mainnet, has over 200 Reputation-holders who have executed over 170 proposals since August 2018, and can be accessed through \"Alchemy\" . Examples The hackers kit is equipped with several examples and sample projects, which we are working to maintain and expand. The goal for these examples is to help developers easily kickstart a new project, as well as to demonstrate some of the features included in each layer of the DAO stack. Starter Template This is a basic template you can use for kickstarting your project using the DAOstack platform. Here you can find the basic structure for using Arc, Client and Subgraph to build your project. Peep DAO This project is a Dapp for interacting with a DAO which has its own DAO social media account on Peepeth , a decentralized microblogging app. The Dapp allows a DAO post Peeps via a decentralized voting mechanism. DutchX DAO Bootstrap This project contains a minimal UI for participating in the bootstrap of the DutchX DAO. The bootstrapping process for a DAO is the process of distributing its initial reputation and tokens. The DutchX bootstrap process is a 3 months period during which users can do several actions, like locking tokens, in order to receive Reputation in the DutchX DAO. You can view the DutchX DAO bootstrapping contracts here . Firestarter DAO Example Firestarter is a community driven crowdsourcing platform, which utilizes DaoStack for governance of the projects.

UGenericScheme : If a DAO does not have a generic scheme registered or want to edit parameters of existing one, then use the already deployed UGenericScheme. GenericScheme : If a DAO wants to have multiple generic scheme i.e. integration with multiple different contracts, then for each subsequent contract (apart from the one already registered via UGenericScheme) you need to deploy an instance of GenericScheme and register it to the DAO. NOTE: While at the contract level GenericScheme only needs encoded call data to function, this is not the user friendly way. You will have to add Alchemy support to be able to use it. Please do not register your scheme on mainnet without adding alchemy support for it How to register Generic Scheme with a DAO DAO only uses the schemes that are registered with its controller. There are two ways to register a scheme: While forging/deploying the DAO as part of initial set of schemes While proposing the new scheme to DAO via any Scheme that has permission to register another Scheme for the DAO. In case of GenesisAlpha you can register via Scheme Registrar Setup Generic Scheme while deploying DAO While deploying DAO, if you want to interact with just single contract then you can use UGenericScheme and register that to your DAO. In case there are multiple contracts you wish to interact with, then you can register multiple GenericScheme and mention each in customSchemes section of your migration-dao-params.json .

Creating Proposal Customize the create proposal popup to present the different functions the scheme can call on the contract.

To get a good understanding of how the Arc framework is built, you can go to this blog post . Arc uses Infra to provide decentralized organizations with voting machines and voting rights management systems. DAOs built with Arc have a few basic contract components: Avatar - The DAO's \"account.\" This contract represents the address of the DAO and holds its assets. Reputation - Voting in Arc is done mainly using Reputation. Reputation can be distributed and redistributed only by DAO decision, and it is generally given (via vote) to an agent according to their performance and contribution to a DAO. Token - Each DAO may have its own token, which can be used in any way the DAO would like. Controller - The controller is the \"Access Control\" of the DAO, managing who can interact with which DAO functions and enforcing the DAO's constraints. Schemes - Schemes are a DAO's \"actions\": anything a DAO should act upon needs to be written and authorized by the controller as a scheme. Schemes might be used to help a DAO: propose and make investments, give reputation to agents, upgrade the DAO's contracts, register new schemes and constraints, etc. Global Constraints - Global constraints are limitations on a DAO's actions. When executing a scheme, the controller checks the constraints to see if the action violates them, and blocks the execution if it does. Some examples for constraints might be: the token supply can't be increased over 1M tokens, the organization won't use more than 60% of its funds at once, etc. Arc utilizes the concept of \"Universal\" contracts : contracts which are deployed once, and then can be used by any number of DAOs simultaneously, saving gas and deployment costs. Schemes and constraints can both be used in this way. To use the already deployed contracts, you can either use Client, which maintains easy access to all universal Arc contracts, or you can use Migration.json to view the addresses of the universal contracts of the latest arc version on the mainnet, Kovan, Rinkeby and Ganache* All contracts listed in the file are universal, meaning that users should use them when needed and not redeploy them. * Please note that the Ganache addresses are based on the DAOstack commands for running and deploying Arc to a local Ganache network, which means those addresses might change if you are using a different method to run Ganache or deploy Arc. Should I work at this level? Using Arc is not necessary to deploy a DAO (you can do this with Migrations currently and in the future as an end user of Dapps), but you might want to work on this layer if you need your DAO to have a unique action, constraint, or voting process that is not yet implemented on Arc.

It provides functions to interact with DAOstack contracts to vote, propose, stake and execute proposals. Client library is also a wrapper around DAOstack subgraph . It enable developers to interact with subgraph and execute various generic graph queries to access proposals, daos and other complex entities Using Client, JavaScript/TypeScript developers can easily write scripts or applications which can interact with existing DAOs, submit proposals to DAOs, vote and stake on proposals, execute the resulting decisions, manage agent reputations. This is particularly helpful for developers who want to get the advantages of decentralized governance on the blockchain without dealing directly with a smart contract language.

Infra contracts can be integrated into any application regardless of its architecture. Infra has two main components: Voting Machines - A voting machine is a universal contract which can operate the voting process for any organization. Each voting machine follows its own predifined rules for the decision making and execution process. Rules for voting machines can be implemented for any voting process, from a simple protocol like an \"Absolute Vote\" (where 51% of the voting power should approve it in order for the decision to pass), or more sophisticated protocols like the Holographic Consensus voting protocol. Voting Rights Management - A voting rights management system determines how voting rights are distributed. Any voting rights management system must have \"balances\" which represents the voting power each participant holds. There are 2 main approaches for managing voting rights: token-based voting and reputation-based voting. The main technical difference between the two is that tokens are transferable (i.e. tradable) while reputation is non-transferable. Another big difference which may appear (depending on implementation) is that a token is a property which cannot be taken while reputation may be redistributed by the organization itself. For most cases, we reccomend using the reputation-based voting model, however, Infra allows any voting right management system to be built. Should I work at this level?
