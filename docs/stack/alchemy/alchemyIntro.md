The Client library facilitates development of "Dapps" (Decentralized applications) for interacting with DAOs.

**DAOstack has built its own Dapp called [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/), a front-end interface for DAOs**, or more specifically, for budget management in decentralized organizations. Alchemy allows end users to make collaborative budgeting decisions and allocations using the [Holographic Consensus protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1De0MoStSkY&feature=youtu.be&t=11m50s).

You can find the Alchemy repo at [github.com/daostack/alchemy](https://github.com/daostack/alchemy).

A second Dapp built by DAOstack is [Vanille](http://daostack.azurewebsites.net) (enable MetaMask). Vanille enables users to create and interact with DAOs before moving to a dedicated interface like Alchemy.

You can find the Vanille repo here: [https://github.com/daostack/vanille](https://github.com/daostack/vanille).

### Should I work at this level?

Build at the Dapp level if you want to create new ways to interact with existing DAOs and DAOstack smart contracts, e.g. a multi-DAO explorer for GEN predictors or a new DAO creation app.
