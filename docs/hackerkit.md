## DAOs

**DAOs can be created for any conceivable collaborative purpose, from local political action to distributed manufacturing and sales.** The goal of DAOstack is to make it as easy as possible to create and manage DAOs, and to use them to drive a new decentralized global economy (specifically, an economy that uses [GEN, our collective attention token](https://medium.com/daostack/on-the-utility-of-the-gen-token-eb4f341d770e)).

**DAOstack Technologies has created an initial DAO called "Genesis" with the purpose of promoting the GEN/DAO ecosystem.** Genesis is currently live on the Ethereum mainnet, has over 200 Reputation-holders who have executed over 170 proposals since August 2018, and can be accessed through ["Alchemy"](https://alchemy.daostack.io/).

## Examples
The hackers kit is equipped with several examples and sample projects, which we are working to maintain and expand. The goal for these examples is to help developers easily kickstart a new project, as well as to demonstrate some of the features included in each layer of the DAO stack.

### [Starter Template](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-Hackers-Kit/tree/master/starter-template)
This is a basic template you can use for kickstarting your project using the DAOstack platform. Here you can find the basic structure for using Arc, Client and Subgraph to build your project.

### [Peep DAO](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-Hackers-Kit/tree/master/peepeth-dao-example)
This project is a Dapp for interacting with a DAO which has its own DAO social media account on [Peepeth](Peepeth.com), a decentralized microblogging app. The Dapp allows a DAO post Peeps via a decentralized voting mechanism.

### [DutchX DAO Bootstrap](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-Hackers-Kit/tree/master/dutchx-bootstrap)
This project contains a minimal UI for participating in the bootstrap of the DutchX DAO.
The bootstrapping process for a DAO is the process of distributing its initial reputation and tokens. The DutchX bootstrap process is a 3 months period during which users can do several actions, like locking tokens, in order to receive Reputation in the DutchX DAO.
You can view the DutchX DAO bootstrapping contracts [here](https://github.com/daostack/arc/tree/master/contracts/schemes).

### [Firestarter DAO Example](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-Hackers-Kit/tree/master/firestarter-example)
Firestarter is a community driven crowdsourcing platform, which utilizes DaoStack for governance of the projects.
This is a striped down version of the project, which only showcases the DaoStack integration.
